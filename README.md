Hastie is intended as replacement of jekyll (for myself), but jekyll has a robust plugin, extensibility and community that I do not expect to even attempt.  If you are looking for a flexible tool to publish your site use jekyll.

If you are looking for a tool to tweek and play with the Go language, then this might be your choice. Most customizations will probably require code changes.  The reason I created the tool was to learn Go, I'm publishing to hopefully help others with playing with the language.

Note: The name Hastie also comes from the novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde

## Install Notes

Install Go: <http://golang.org/doc/install.html#fetch>

Get Hastie: `go get github.com/mkaz/hastie`

Install Hastie: `go install ./src/github.com/mkaz/hastie/cmd/hastie`


#### Libraries

Uses **blackfriday** for markdown conversion. `go get github.com/russross/blackfriday`


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Usage

    usage: hastie [flags]
      -c="hastie.json": Config file
      -h=false: show this help
      -http="": HTTP service address (e.g., ':8080')
      -m=false: do not use markdown conversion
      -t=false: display timing
      -v=false: verbose output

Configuration file format (default ./hastie.json)

    {
      "SourceDir" : "posts",
      "LayoutDir" : "layouts",
      "PublishDir": "public"
    }


Hastie walks through a templates directory and generates HTML files to a publish directory. It uses Go's template language for templates and markdown for content.

Here is sample site layout: (see test directory)

    layouts/footer.html
    layouts/header.html
    layouts/indexpage.html
    layouts/post.html
    posts/2011-03-02-angelica.html
    posts/index.md
    posts/zebra/2009-12-12-sample-post.md
    posts/zebra/2012-02-14-hastie-intro.md


This will generate:

    public/angelica.html
    public/index.html
    public/zebra/sample-post.html
    public/zebra/hastie-intro.html


A few current limitations:

  * all files must be have .md extension

The usage of hastie is just as a template engine, it does not copy over any images, does not have a built-in web server or any of the other features that jekyll has.

I keep the `public` directory full with all of the assets for the site such as images, stylesheets, etc and hastie copies in the html files. So if you delete a template it won't be removed from `public`


Data available to templates:

    .Title        -- Page Title
    .Date         -- Page Date format using .Date.Format "Jan 2, 2006"
    .Content      -- Converted HTML Content
    .Category     -- Category (directory)
    .OutFile      -- file path
    .Recent       -- list most recent files, latest first
    .Url          -- Url for this page
    .PrevUrl      -- Previous Page Url
    .PrevTitle    -- Previous Page Title
    .NextUrl      -- Next Page Url
    .NextTitle    -- Next Page Title
    .PrevCatUrl   -- Previous Page Url by Category
    .PrevCatTitle -- Previous Page Title by Category
    .NextCatUrl   -- Next Page Url by Category
    .NextCatTitle -- Next Page Title by Category
    .Params       -- Map of User Parameters, set in page head
    .Params.BaseUrl -- BaseUrl as defined in hastie.json

    .Categories.CATEGORY -- list of most recent files for CATEGORY


Functions Available:

    .Recent.Limit n           -- will limit recent list to n items
    .Categories.Get CATEGORY  -- will fetch category list CATEGORY, useful for dynamic categories


Examples:

    Show 3 most recent titles:
        {{ range .Recent.Limit 3 }}
          {{ .Title }}
        {{ end }}

    Show 3 most recent from math category:
        {{ range .CategoryList.math }}
          {{ .Title }}
        {{ end }}


### Using Filters (Example: Less CSS, CoffeeScript)

Hastie allows for the use of any command-line processing of files, provided the process takes the filename as input and spits out the results. It does so using `processFilters` configuration. You set a file extension mapped to the utility to process and the final extension.

Add follow configuration to hastie.json

      "processFilters": {
        "less": ["/usr/local/bin/lessc", "css"]
      }

So the above example any files with the extension `.less` will be converted to `.css` using lessc binary and copied to the public directory at the same spot in the directory tree as the original less file.

### TODO
* Create syntax highlighting blocks
* Add ability to support rss.xml

* Read .html files and apply template, no markdown


#### Bugs
* Add nicer error message/detection when no config found
* Add nicer error detection when error with template
* Should template variables work in source files ??
