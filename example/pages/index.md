title: Welcome to Hastie
---

Hastie is a static site generator similar to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). Hastie can be used to generate blogs, documentation sites, or customized to whatever suits your needs. 


## Background

I created Hastie as a blogging centric replacement for Jekyll. I wanted a project to play with and learn Go, I'm a firm believer the best way to learn something is to build something. At the time, I upgraded OSX and it broke my Ruby dependencies giving me a headache. The beauty of Go is it produces a binary that is completely portable, once built there are no dependencies.

I've tweaked Hastie over the years to be less blogging and more documentation focused. If you want a great blogging tool just use WordPress; and the easiest WordPress setup is a hosted site on [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com) it's great and you'll be up in minutes. Disclaimer: I'm biased, I contribute to WordPress and work for WordPress.com.

If you are looking for a tool to generate docs, probably requires tweaking, playing with and maybe learn along the way, then Hastie might be it. The reason I created the tool was to learn Go, I open sourced to hopefully help others to learn and something to play with. Please fork and tweak.

Note: The name Hastie is from a character in the novel Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
